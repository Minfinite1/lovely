          <h2>Here's a timeline of Muhammad's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>570 CE - Birth</strong><br>Muhammad was born in Mecca, in the Arabian Peninsula. He belonged to the Quraysh tribe, a respected merchant tribe.
</li>
            <li><strong>576 CE – Death of His Mother</strong><br>At age six, Muhammad lost his mother, Amina, leaving him an orphan. He was then raised by his grandfather and later by his uncle, Abu Talib.</li>
            <li><strong>578 CE – Death of His Grandfather</strong><br>After the death of his grandfather, Muhammad came under the care of his uncle, who provided him with protection and guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>595 CE – Marriage to Khadijah</strong><br>Muhammad, at 25, married Khadijah, a wealthy widow 15 years his senior. Their marriage was supportive and marked by mutual respect; they had several children together.</li>
            <li><strong>610 CE – First Revelation</strong><br>At the age of 40, Muhammad received his first revelation from the Angel Gabriel while meditating in the Cave of Hira. This marked the beginning of his prophethood.</li>
            <li><strong>613 CE – Public Preaching Begins</strong><br>Muhammad began to publicly preach Islam, calling for monotheism and social justice. This led to opposition from the Quraysh leaders.</li>
            <li><strong>615 CE – First Migration to Abyssinia</strong><br>Facing persecution in Mecca, some of Muhammad’s followers migrated to Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) seeking refuge under the Christian king, Negus.</li>
            <li><strong>619 CE – Death of Khadih</strong><br>Khadijah passed away, marking a personal loss for Muhammad, who had relied on her support throughout his prophethood.</li>
            <li><strong>620 CE – Night Journey and Ascension</strong><br>According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad experienced the Isra and Mi'raj, a miraculous night journey to Jerusalem and ascension to the heavens, reinforcing his role as a prophet.</li>
            <li><strong>622 CE – Hijra to Medina</strong><br>Due to increasing hostility in Mecca, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina (then Yathrib), marking the start of the Islamic calendar.</li>
            <li><strong>624 CE – Battle of Badr</strong><br>Muhammad led his followers in the Battle of Badr, a pivotal victory against the Quraysh, which solidified his position in Medina and bolstered Muslim morale.</li>
            <li><strong>625 CE – Battle of Uhud</strong><br>The Muslims faced a setback in the Battle of Uhud against the Quraysh. Although they showed bravery, strategic mistakes led to a loss, highlighting the need for unity.</li>
            <li><strong>628 CE – Treaty of Hudaybiyyah</strong><br>A pivotal peace treaty with the Quraysh allowed Muslims to return to Mecca for pilgrimage, significantly improving the Muslim community's standing.</li>
            <li><strong>630 CE – Conquest of Mecca</strong><br>Muhammad and his followers peacefully entered Mecca, reclaimed the Kaaba, and established it as the center of Islamic worship, solidifying the faith’s presence.</li>
            <li><strong>632 CE – Farewell Pilgrimage</strong><br>Muhammad performed his final pilgrimage, delivering the Farewell Sermon, which emphasized equality, justice, and the core tenets of Islam.</li>
            <li><strong>632 CE – Death</strong><br>Muhammad died in Medina after a brief illness at the age of 63. His death marked the end of his prophetic mission but the beginning of the spread of Islam across the world.</li>

          <blockquote>
            <i>"All mankind is equal; no one has superiority over another except by piety and good action. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and He will indeed hold you accountable for your deeds.<br>

O people, I leave behind me two things, and if you follow them, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah and my Sunnah (tradition).<br>

Take care of your women; treat them well. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under the trust of Allah and with His permission."</i>
